*IOT BASED AIR POLLUTION

## 1. INTRODUCTION

### IOT Based Air Pollution 
Monitoring System monitors the Air quality over a 
web server using Internet and will trigger an alarm 
when the air quality goes down beyond a certain 
threshold level, means when there are sufficient 
amount of harmful gases present in the air like CO2, 
smoke, alcohol, benzene, NH3, LPG and NOx. It will 
show the air quality in PPM on the LCD and as well 
as on webpage so that it can monitor it very easily. 
LPG sensor is added in this system which is used 
mostly in houses. The system will show temperature 
and humidity. IOT Based Air Pollution Monitoring System monitors 
the Air Quality over a webserver using internet and 
will trigger an alarm when the air quality goes down 
beyond a certain level, means when there are amount 
of harmful gases present in the air like CO2, smoke, 
alcohol, benzene, NH3, NOx and LPG.

## 4. COMPONENTS:

### 1) Arduino UNO:-
![Arduino MS](https://github.com/anuj11T/Pollution_IOT_Project/assets/140873986/5cc7c633-a1c7-411f-bc61-10e317b7d659)
Arduino Uno is a microcontroller board based on 
the ATmega328P
 It has 14 digital input/output pins 6 analog inputs, a 
16 MHz quartz crystal, a USB Connection, power 
jack, an ICSP header and a reset button


### 2) MQ135 sensor:-
![MQ135 Sensor MS](https://github.com/anuj11T/Pollution_IOT_Project/assets/140873986/38a54a56-d84c-4f09-9d27-278cdaccb659)

The MQ135 sensor can sense NH3, NOx, alcohol, 
Benzene, smoke, CO2 and some other gases.
It gives the output in form of voltage levels.

### 3) WIFI Module (ESP8266):-
The ESP8266 is a low-cost Wi-Fi chip with full 
TCP/IP stack and MCU (microcontroller unit) 
capability.
It runs on 3.3V and gives our system access to Wi-Fi 
or internet

### 4) Buzzer:-
A Buzzer or beeper is an audio signaling device.Whenever the air pollution goes above the threshold 
level the Buzzer starts beeping indicating Danger.

### 5) LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):-
![LCD DISPLAY (2)](https://github.com/anuj11T/Pollution_IOT_Project/assets/140873986/489f77b2-96d9-416d-8f94-08ef61a35a3e)

This is a basic (16x2) 16 character by 2 line display. 
Black text on Green background.
It is used to indicate the Air and Humidity in PPM

### 6) GSM Module:-
![GSM MS](https://github.com/anuj11T/Pollution_IOT_Project/assets/140873986/82022207-7e61-4c24-80a7-cb6caac4a8fa)

GSM Module is used to establish communication 
between a computer and a GSM system.
Global System for Mobile communication (GSM) is 
an architecture used for mobile communication

 ### 7)LPG Sensor:-
 ![MQ6 MS](https://github.com/anuj11T/Pollution_IOT_Project/assets/140873986/e1484390-5cea-43c2-8920-9feff22f22d0)

MQ-6 sensor is a simple-to-use liquefied petroleum 
gas (LPG) sensor, suitable for sensing LPG
(composed of mostly propane and butane) 
concentrations in the air. 
The MQ-6 can detect gas concentrations anywhere 
from 200 to 10000ppm.

### 8) Temperature Sensor:-
The LM35 is precision integrated-circuit temperature 
sensor, whose output voltage is linearly proportional 
to the Celsius (Centigrade) temperature. 
It can be used with single power supplies, or with 
plus and minus supplies.

### 9) Humidity Sensor:-
The humidity sensor is of capacitive type, comprising 
on chip signal conditioner. 
However, it is mounted on the PCB, which also 
consists of other stages employed to make sensor 
rather smarter. 
The PCB consists of CMOS timers to pulse the 
sensor to provide output voltage.

## 5. Applications:-


1) Industrial perimeter monitoring
2) Indoor air quality monitoring.
3) Site selection for reference monitoring stations.
4) Making data available to users.


## 6. Advantages:-

1) Easy to Install
2) Updates On mobile phone directly 
3) Accurate Pollution monitoring 
4) Remote location monitoring


## 7. Conclusion:-

 The system to monitor the air of environment using 
Arduino microcontroller, IOT Technology is proposed 
to improve quality of air. With the use of IOT
technology enhances the process of monitoring 
various aspects of environment such as air quality 
monitoring issue proposed in this paper. Here, using 
the MQ135 and MQ6 gas sensor gives the sense of 
different type of dangerous gas and arduino is the heart 
of this project.
Which control the entire process. Wi-Fi module 
connects the whole process to internet and LCD is 
used for the visual Output.
